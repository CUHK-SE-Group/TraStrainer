# Data of TraStrainer
Here, we release datasets based on two open-source microservice benchmarks, TrainTicket and Hipster(OnlineBoutique). We also provide a demo input for testing purposes. A part of the datasets involves proprietary production data from a company, which is currently not publicly available. However, there are plans to release the data after applying anonymization techniques to protect sensitive information.
